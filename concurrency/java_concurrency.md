# Java Concurrency Interview Guide

## 1. Basic Thread Management and Synchronization

**Overview:**  
Java threads are the fundamental building blocks for concurrent programming. Each thread represents an independent path of execution within a program, allowing multiple operations to occur simultaneously.

Thread creation in Java can be done in two ways:
1. **Extending the Thread class**: Override the `run()` method to define the thread's behavior
2. **Implementing the Runnable interface**: Pass the Runnable to a Thread constructor

A thread's lifecycle consists of six states:
- **New**: Created but not started
- **Runnable**: Running or ready to run (scheduled by the JVM)
- **Blocked**: Waiting for a monitor lock to enter a synchronized block/method
- **Waiting**: Called `wait()`, `join()` or `park()` with no timeout
- **Timed Waiting**: Called `sleep()`, `wait()`, `join()` or `park()` with timeout
- **Terminated**: Completed execution or thrown an uncaught exception

Synchronization is crucial for thread safety and is primarily achieved through:
- **The `synchronized` keyword**: Applied to methods or blocks to ensure mutual exclusion
- **Intrinsic locks (monitors)**: Every object has an intrinsic lock used by the `synchronized` mechanism
- **`wait()`, `notify()`, and `notifyAll()`**: Used for inter-thread communication within synchronized contexts
- **Join method**: Allows one thread to wait for another thread's completion

Common thread issues include race conditions (when multiple threads access shared data concurrently), deadlocks (circular wait for resources), and thread starvation (threads unable to gain regular access to shared resources).

**Interview Questions:**

**Easy:**
- What is the difference between `start()` and `run()` methods in the Thread class?
- Explain the purpose of the `synchronized` keyword in Java.

**Medium:**
- Implement a producer-consumer pattern using `wait()` and `notify()` methods.
- What is thread starvation? How can it be prevented?

**Hard:**
- Design a thread-safe singleton pattern with lazy initialization that addresses the double-checked locking problem.
- Implement a custom synchronization mechanism similar to a semaphore without using Java's built-in Semaphore class.

## 2. Thread Safety with Locks, Volatile, and Atomic Variables

**Overview:**  
For fine-grained concurrency control, Java provides advanced mechanisms beyond basic synchronization:

**Explicit Locks (java.util.concurrent.locks):**
- **ReentrantLock**: Offers the same basic behavior as synchronized blocks but with additional features like timed waiting, interruptible lock acquisition, fairness policies, and non-block-structured locking
- **ReadWriteLock**: Allows multiple concurrent readers but exclusive access for writers, optimizing for read-heavy workloads
- **StampedLock**: Java 8 addition that provides optimistic reading without acquiring a lock, with fallback to read/write locking when necessary

**The `volatile` keyword:**
- Guarantees memory visibility across threads (changes made in one thread are visible to others)
- Prevents instruction reordering optimizations by the compiler or JVM
- Provides a happens-before relationship without locking
- Does NOT provide atomicity for compound operations (i.e., check-then-act, read-modify-write)
- Primarily useful for flags, state variables, or single-writer scenarios

**Atomic Variables (java.util.concurrent.atomic):**
- Provides non-blocking, thread-safe operations on single variables
- Leverages CPU-specific atomic instructions (like Compare-And-Swap) for efficiency
- Common classes include: AtomicBoolean, AtomicInteger, AtomicLong, AtomicReference
- Supports compound operations atomically (getAndSet, getAndIncrement, compareAndSet)
- Offers field updaters for existing classes (AtomicIntegerFieldUpdater)
- Enhanced in Java 8 with accumulators and adders for high-contention scenarios

**Memory Consistency and Happens-Before Relationship:**
- Java Memory Model (JMM) defines rules for when memory writes by one thread are visible to reads by another
- The happens-before relationship is the fundamental ordering guarantee
- Actions like lock acquisition/release, volatile reads/writes, thread start/join establish happens-before edges
- Understanding these relationships is crucial for writing correct concurrent code

**Interview Questions:**

**Easy:**
- What is the purpose of the `volatile` keyword in Java? When should it be used?
- Explain the difference between `synchronized` blocks and `java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock`.

**Medium:**
- Implement a thread-safe counter using AtomicInteger and compare its performance with a synchronized counter.
- Explain the difference between optimistic and pessimistic locking. Provide examples of each in Java.

**Hard:**
- Implement a custom non-blocking concurrent data structure (e.g., a lock-free stack) using atomic variables.
- Design a custom read-write lock that allows downgrading from write lock to read lock but prevents upgrading from read lock to write lock.

## 3. Concurrent Collections

**Overview:**  
Java's concurrent collections framework (in `java.util.concurrent`) provides thread-safe data structures optimized for different concurrent access patterns and use cases:

**ConcurrentHashMap:**
- Thread-safe alternative to `HashMap` and synchronized `Collections.synchronizedMap()`
- Uses lock striping (segmentation) to allow concurrent reads and a configurable number of concurrent writes
- Provides atomic compound operations like `putIfAbsent()`, `replace()`, and `remove(key, value)`
- Avoids full-map locking, resulting in better scalability than synchronized maps
- Offers additional features like atomic bulk operations, forEach methods, and search/reduce operations in Java 8+
- Does not allow null keys or values (unlike HashMap)

**CopyOnWriteArrayList and CopyOnWriteArraySet:**
- Implements mutative operations (add, set, remove) by creating a fresh copy of the underlying array
- Ideal for read-heavy workloads with infrequent modifications
- No synchronization needed for read operations, providing excellent read performance
- Iterator provides a snapshot view that never throws ConcurrentModificationException
- Memory-intensive for large collections or frequent modifications

**BlockingQueue implementations:**
- **ArrayBlockingQueue**: Bounded, array-backed implementation with optional fairness policy
- **LinkedBlockingQueue**: Optionally bounded, linked-node implementation with separate locks for head and tail
- **PriorityBlockingQueue**: Unbounded priority queue using the same ordering rules as `PriorityQueue`
- **DelayQueue**: Unbounded blocking queue of elements with a delay time before becoming available
- **SynchronousQueue**: Queue with no internal capacity where each insert operation must wait for a corresponding remove
- **LinkedTransferQueue**: (Java 7+) Combines features of SynchronousQueue and LinkedBlockingQueue with better performance
- Support operations that wait for the queue to become non-empty or have space available (take/put methods)

**Other Concurrent Collections:**
- **ConcurrentSkipListMap/Set**: Concurrent sorted map/set based on a skip list data structure
- **ConcurrentLinkedQueue/Deque**: Non-blocking queue/deque implementations
- **LinkedBlockingDeque**: Blocking implementation of the Deque interface

These collections employ various concurrency strategies like lock striping, non-blocking algorithms (using atomic operations), and copy-on-write semantics to optimize for different usage patterns and tradeoffs between throughput, contention, memory usage, and consistency guarantees.

**Interview Questions:**

**Easy:**
- What is the difference between `HashMap` and `ConcurrentHashMap`?
- Explain the purpose of `BlockingQueue` and name some of its implementations.

**Medium:**
- Implement a rate limiter using a BlockingQueue.
- Explain how ConcurrentHashMap achieves high concurrency. What is the significance of its concurrency level?

**Hard:**
- Design a custom concurrent cache with time-based eviction policy.
- Implement a thread-safe priority queue that supports concurrent operations with minimal contention.

## 4. Executors and Thread Pools

**Overview:**  
The Executor framework in `java.util.concurrent` provides a high-level abstraction for asynchronous task execution, separating task submission from execution mechanics:

**Executor Interface Hierarchy:**
- **Executor**: Basic interface with `execute(Runnable)` method
- **ExecutorService**: Extended interface with lifecycle management and `submit()` methods returning `Future` objects
- **ScheduledExecutorService**: Adds scheduling capabilities for delayed or periodic task execution

**ThreadPoolExecutor:**
- Core implementation of ExecutorService that maintains a pool of worker threads
- Configurable with core pool size, maximum pool size, keep-alive time, work queue, thread factory, and rejection policy
- Thread lifecycle management: keeps core threads alive (even when idle), creates additional threads when needed up to max size, and removes idle non-core threads after the keep-alive time
- Work queue holds tasks when all threads are busy, with different queuing strategies available

**Predefined Thread Pools (via Executors factory class):**
- **newFixedThreadPool(n)**: Fixed number of threads with an unbounded queue
- **newCachedThreadPool()**: Expandable pool that creates new threads as needed and reuses idle threads
- **newSingleThreadExecutor()**: Single-thread executor with an unbounded queue, guaranteeing FIFO execution
- **newScheduledThreadPool(n)**: Fixed-size pool for scheduled tasks execution
- **newWorkStealingPool()**: (Java 8+) ForkJoinPool implementation with work-stealing algorithm

**ForkJoinPool:**
- Specialized for divide-and-conquer algorithms and work-stealing patterns
- Designed for tasks that recursively break down into smaller subtasks
- Worker threads can "steal" tasks from other threads' queues when they become idle
- Supports both fork/join and standard executor interfaces
- Default common pool is used by parallel streams in Java 8+

**Task Submission and Future:**
- Submit tasks as `Runnable` (no return value) or `Callable` (returns a value)
- Returns a `Future` object representing the pending result
- Future methods include `get()` (blocking), `get(timeout)`, `cancel()`, `isDone()`, and `isCancelled()`
- Can convert between Runnable and Callable using adapter methods

**Thread Pool Best Practices:**
- Proper sizing based on CPU cores, I/O-bound vs. CPU-bound tasks
- Rejection policies for handling overflow (abort, caller-runs, discard, discard-oldest)
- Shutdown handling with `shutdown()` vs. `shutdownNow()`
- Monitoring and tuning through JMX or custom metrics

**Common Pitfalls:**
- Thread leakage from improperly configured pools
- Deadlocks from mismanaged dependencies between tasks
- Thread starvation from overly long-running tasks
- Resource exhaustion from unbounded work queues

**Interview Questions:**

**Easy:**
- What is the purpose of `ExecutorService` in Java? How is it different from creating threads directly?
- Explain the difference between `newFixedThreadPool()`, `newCachedThreadPool()`, and `newSingleThreadExecutor()`.

**Medium:**
- Implement a custom ThreadPoolExecutor with a bounded queue and a custom rejection policy.
- How would you design a system to limit the number of concurrent requests to a database?

**Hard:**
- Implement a work-stealing thread pool similar to ForkJoinPool.
- Design and implement a priority-based thread pool where tasks with higher priority are executed before tasks with lower priority.

## 5. CompletableFuture for Asynchronous Programming

**Overview:**  
`CompletableFuture` (introduced in Java 8) represents a significant evolution in Java's asynchronous programming model, providing a rich functional API for composing, combining, and handling asynchronous operations:

**Core Capabilities:**
- Implements both `Future` and `CompletionStage` interfaces
- Can be explicitly completed (unlike regular Futures)
- Supports non-blocking composition of dependent operations
- Provides built-in exception handling mechanisms
- Can be used with or without an explicit Executor

**Creation Methods:**
- **Static factories**: `completedFuture(result)`, `supplyAsync(supplier)`, `runAsync(runnable)`
- **Manual completion**: `new CompletableFuture<>()` with `complete(value)` or `completeExceptionally(ex)`
- **From CompletionStage**: `minimalCompletionStage()`, `toCompletableFuture()`
- **Empty/failed**: `failedFuture(ex)` (Java 9+), `completedStage(value)` (Java 9+)

**Transformation and Composition:**
- **Sequential transformations**:
  - `thenApply(fn)`: Transform result using a function (like `map`)
  - `thenAccept(consumer)`: Consume result without returning a value
  - `thenRun(runnable)`: Run action after completion, ignoring result
- **Asynchronous versions**:
  - `thenApplyAsync()`, `thenAcceptAsync()`, `thenRunAsync()` with optional Executor
- **Composition**:
  - `thenCompose(fn)`: Chain futures where one future depends on the previous result (like `flatMap`)
  - `thenCombine(other, fn)`: Combine results of two independent futures
  - `allOf(cfs...)`: Wait for all futures to complete
  - `anyOf(cfs...)`: Wait for any future to complete

**Error Handling:**
- `exceptionally(fn)`: Recover from exceptions with a fallback value
- `handle(fn)`: Process result or exception (like a try/catch/finally)
- `whenComplete(fn)`: Run action on completion without affecting the result or exception
- Exception propagation through composition chains follows structured concurrency principles

**Timing Control:**
- `orTimeout(timeout, unit)`: Complete exceptionally after timeout (Java 9+)
- `completeOnTimeout(value, timeout, unit)`: Provide default value after timeout (Java 9+)
- `delayedExecutor(delay, unit)`: Create delayed executor for async operations (Java 9+)

**Advanced Features:**
- **Completion cancellation**: `cancel(mayInterruptIfRunning)` (from Future interface)
- **Completion polling**: `isDone()`, `isCompletedExceptionally()`, `isCancelled()`
- **Non-blocking get**: `getNow(valueIfAbsent)` returns immediately without blocking
- **Completion triggers**: `complete(value)`, `completeExceptionally(ex)`

**Real-world Applications:**
- Parallel API calls aggregation
- Asynchronous event processing pipelines
- Background task orchestration with dependencies
- Reactive programming patterns with completion signaling
- Service composition with fallback mechanisms

**Interview Questions:**

**Easy:**
- What is the difference between `Future` and `CompletableFuture`?
- Explain how to combine multiple CompletableFutures using `thenCombine()` method.

**Medium:**
- Implement an asynchronous REST client that makes multiple API calls in parallel and combines the results.
- How would you handle exceptions in a chain of CompletableFuture operations?

**Hard:**
- Design a reactive pipeline using CompletableFuture that processes events from multiple sources with backpressure support.
- Implement a custom ThreadFactory for CompletableFuture that prioritizes tasks based on their dependencies.

## 6. Common Concurrency Design Patterns
