# Chapter 7: Real-World Case Studies in Mixed Workload Optimization

## Case Study 1: User Analytics Platform

### Scenario Overview

Consider a large-scale user analytics platform processing billions of events daily while serving both dashboard queries and real-time user profile lookups. The platform faces several challenging requirements: maintaining sub-second response times for user profile queries, processing complex aggregations for dashboards, and handling real-time updates to user profiles.

The event data includes user interactions, profile updates, and system events. Each event contains rich JSON data with nested structures, making efficient storage and query optimization crucial. The system needs to handle both point queries looking up specific user profiles and complex OLAP queries analyzing user behavior patterns across millions of events.

### Implementation Strategy

The solution employs a sophisticated multi-tiered approach to data organization. User profile data, frequently accessed through point queries, is stored with optimized index structures. The system maintains computed columns for frequently accessed JSON paths, transforming common JSON operations into direct column access. This dramatically improves point query performance without sacrificing the flexibility of JSON storage.

For the OLAP workload, the system implements a carefully designed Star-Tree index structure. The dimension selection for the Star-Tree focuses on common dashboard query patterns, pre-aggregating data along frequently accessed paths. This provides sub-second response times for complex dashboard queries while maintaining reasonable storage overhead.

### Performance Impact

The implementation showed dramatic improvements in mixed workload handling:
- Point queries consistently achieve sub-50ms latency even under heavy OLAP query load
- Dashboard queries maintain sub-second response times for 95th percentile queries
- Storage overhead from indexing remains under 20% of raw data size
- Real-time ingestion continues at over 100,000 events per second while serving queries

## Case Study 2: E-Commerce Analytics

### Scenario Overview

An e-commerce platform needs to handle both real-time product analytics and historical trend analysis. The system processes product views, purchases, and inventory updates, requiring both immediate access to current product statistics and complex historical analysis. The challenge lies in maintaining real-time accuracy for product-level queries while efficiently processing large-scale analytical queries.

The data model includes complex relationships between products, categories, and user interactions. Each product event contains detailed attributes including price changes, inventory levels, and user interaction data. The system must handle both individual product lookups and complex aggregations across product categories and time ranges.

### Optimization Approach

The system implements a hybrid indexing strategy optimized for both access patterns. Product-level data employs inverted indexes on key attributes, enabling fast point queries for product statistics. These indexes are carefully selected based on query patterns to minimize storage overhead while maximizing query performance.

For analytical queries, the system uses a combination of Star-Tree indexes and specialized time-based optimization structures. The Star-Tree dimensions are chosen based on common analytical query patterns, with special attention to time-based aggregations which form the core of trend analysis queries.

### Results and Learnings

The implementation revealed several key insights:
- Selective use of inverted indexes on product attributes reduced point query latency by 80%
- Time-based partitioning improved historical query performance by 60%
- Real-time segment organization enables immediate visibility of product updates
- Resource isolation between query types prevents analytical queries from impacting product lookups

## Case Study 3: Financial Data Platform

### Scenario Overview

A financial data platform needs to handle both real-time market data queries and complex historical analysis. The system processes market trades, order book updates, and analytical computations, requiring both immediate access to current market data and sophisticated historical analysis. The particular challenge lies in maintaining accuracy and performance across vastly different time scales and query patterns.

The data includes tick-by-tick market data, aggregated market statistics, and derived analytical metrics. Each record contains multiple numerical values and complex relationships between different market entities. The system must handle both precise point-in-time queries and extensive time-series analysis.

### Technical Implementation

The solution employs a sophisticated segmentation strategy where recent data is organized for optimal point query performance while historical data is structured for analytical efficiency. Recent market data segments maintain comprehensive index structures enabling fast point queries, while historical segments employ optimized columnar storage and aggregation structures.

The system implements a novel approach to time-based indexing where different time resolutions are managed through specialized index structures. This enables efficient query processing across different time scales while maintaining reasonable storage overhead.

### Performance Characteristics

The implementation demonstrated several key performance characteristics:
- Point queries for current market data consistently achieve sub-10ms latency
- Historical analysis queries process billions of records in seconds
- Storage efficiency maintains 10:1 compression ratio despite comprehensive indexing
- Real-time updates remain consistent under heavy analytical query load

## Key Learnings Across Case Studies

### Pattern Recognition

Several common patterns emerged across these implementations:
- The importance of selective indexing based on actual query patterns
- The value of separating recent and historical data optimization strategies
- The effectiveness of computed columns for frequently accessed paths
- The critical role of resource isolation between query types

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

The case studies also revealed several approaches to avoid:
- Over-indexing based on theoretical query patterns rather than actual usage
- Treating all JSON paths equally in terms of optimization
- Ignoring the temporal nature of data in index design
- Applying the same optimization strategies to both recent and historical data
