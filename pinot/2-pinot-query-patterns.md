# Chapter 5: Optimizing Specific Query Patterns

## JSON Data Aggregation Patterns

### Understanding JSON Storage and Access

When dealing with JSON data in Pinot, the storage and access patterns significantly impact query performance. Pinot offers multiple approaches to handling JSON data, each with distinct performance characteristics. At the storage level, JSON fields can be handled either as a single JSON string column or as flattened individual columns. The choice between these approaches fundamentally affects how efficiently Pinot can process aggregation queries.

In the case of storing JSON as a single column, Pinot must parse the JSON structure during query execution. This parsing overhead becomes particularly significant when dealing with large volumes of data or complex JSON structures. The system employs several optimization strategies to mitigate this overhead, including JSON path caching and selective parsing, where only the required fields are extracted from the JSON structure.

### Optimizing JSON Field Aggregations

When aggregating over JSON fields, the query performance heavily depends on how the JSON data is structured and indexed. For frequently accessed JSON fields, Pinot offers the ability to create computed columns during segment generation. These computed columns essentially materialize specific JSON paths as separate columns, enabling direct access without JSON parsing overhead. This approach transforms the runtime JSON parsing cost into a one-time computation during segment generation.

Consider a common scenario where you have a JSON column containing user activity data, and you frequently need to aggregate metrics based on specific activity attributes. Instead of repeatedly parsing the JSON structure during query execution, you can create computed columns for the commonly accessed paths. This transforms the query from a JSON parsing operation to a simple column access, dramatically improving aggregation performance.

### Advanced JSON Query Patterns

Pinot's handling of complex JSON aggregations becomes particularly sophisticated when dealing with nested structures and arrays. The system employs intelligent caching strategies where frequently accessed JSON paths are cached at multiple levels - both in memory and in the segment's metadata. This caching mechanism significantly reduces the parsing overhead for subsequent queries accessing the same JSON paths.

When dealing with JSON arrays, Pinot provides specialized handling through multi-valued columns. This becomes particularly important in scenarios where aggregations need to operate over array elements. The system can efficiently unroll JSON arrays into multi-valued columns during segment generation, enabling high-performance aggregations without runtime array parsing overhead.

## Time-Series Aggregation Patterns

### Timestamp-Based Aggregations

Time-series data presents unique optimization opportunities in Pinot. The system's handling of timestamp-based aggregations leverages several specialized techniques to maintain high performance. At the storage level, timestamps are typically encoded using efficient numeric representations, allowing for fast range comparisons and grouping operations.

When aggregating time-series data, Pinot employs intelligent bucketing strategies. The system can automatically align time boundaries to common intervals (hours, days, weeks) during segment generation, enabling efficient pre-aggregation. This pre-alignment significantly reduces the computational overhead during query execution, particularly for commonly used time windows.

### Real-Time Aggregation Optimization

Real-time aggregation queries present additional challenges, particularly when dealing with both historical and real-time data. Pinot employs sophisticated strategies to handle these scenarios efficiently, including maintaining separate aggregation paths for real-time and historical data, then combining results intelligently based on query requirements.

## High-Cardinality Dimension Aggregations

### Optimization Strategies for High-Cardinality Fields

High-cardinality dimensions require special consideration in aggregation queries. Pinot employs several strategies to maintain performance when aggregating over fields with large numbers of distinct values. The system can dynamically choose between different execution strategies based on the cardinality of the dimension and the specific aggregation requirements.

For very high-cardinality dimensions, Pinot might opt to use bloom filters or other probabilistic data structures to optimize filter operations before performing aggregations. This becomes particularly important when combining high-cardinality filters with aggregations, as it can dramatically reduce the amount of data that needs to be processed.

### Memory Management in High-Cardinality Aggregations

Memory management becomes crucial when dealing with high-cardinality aggregations. Pinot employs sophisticated spilling strategies where aggregation states can be temporarily moved to disk if memory pressure becomes too high. The system carefully balances memory usage across different queries and aggregation operations to maintain stable performance even under heavy load.

## Multi-Column Aggregation Patterns

### Composite Key Optimization

When dealing with aggregations involving multiple columns, Pinot employs specialized optimization techniques. The system can create composite keys during segment generation, effectively pre-computing common column combinations used in group-by clauses. This approach transforms multiple column lookups into a single composite key lookup, significantly improving performance for common query patterns.

### Intelligent Column Organization

The physical organization of columns within segments plays a crucial role in multi-column aggregation performance. Pinot employs intelligent column grouping strategies where columns frequently accessed together in queries are stored in proximity within the segment. This approach improves cache locality and reduces I/O overhead during query execution.

## Approximate Aggregation Patterns

### Probabilistic Data Structures

For scenarios where approximate results are acceptable, Pinot provides highly optimized approximate aggregation techniques. These include specialized data structures like HyperLogLog for distinct count estimation and quantile sketches for percentile calculations. These probabilistic approaches can provide orders of magnitude performance improvement while maintaining acceptable error bounds.

The system intelligently decides when to use approximate versus exact aggregation methods based on query hints, data characteristics, and system load. This flexibility allows for dynamic optimization based on specific use case requirements and performance constraints.
